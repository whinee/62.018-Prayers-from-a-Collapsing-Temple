\chapter{Roasted Garlic \& Ricotta}

Many a promise broken

Many a time this heart was broken

Many a month has passed

\emph{Oh, magic pill, where hast thou magic been?}

When would this end?

Tortured. Fettered. Indentured.

It should end soon!

It should end soon\ldots{}

We rushed to a place with

Dim fluorescent lights that illuminate misery

Even that of \emph{the thing} behind my skull

Talked to a lot of unfamiliar faces

The plea of help was so loud, yet so silent

``What's the chief complaint?''

\emph{I can only sleep from 1-5 hours at a time}

Irritable. Agitated. Restless.

MAGIC PILL, MY ASS!

\emph{Was that problematic?}

``Not really.''

She smiled at me, reassuring no one

Not even herself

Was given the promised land, but not quiet so

And off we went to a yellow glow

Full of celebration and happiness

Oh, the garlicy goodness of unsure tomorrow

horrible, horrible. horrible. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE

{\LARGE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!}

And oh, wouldn't ya' look at that: 5mg and still couldn't sleep

More than 20mg and I'm finished―

By my doctors, or by the grim reaper, I wouldn't know

I'm still trying to find the right dosage

To peacefully slumber for days on end

But not eternally so

Perhaps, it would be better

If it did\ldots{}
