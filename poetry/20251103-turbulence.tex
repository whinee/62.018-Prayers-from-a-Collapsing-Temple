\chapter{Turbulence}

\centering

Oh, restless nights

How delightfully despairful you are!

Who am I without you?

Came 3 times

Drank antipsychotics

And we're still here

We're still here...

What is this?

What are we?

Who are you to make me this restless?

I can hear your breaths that I so desperately try to match with mine

I can hear the turbulence in your fan

I can hear the turbulence in my heart

I can hear the turbulence in whatever the fuck this is

Static. Blurry. Unsettling.

You're still in a deep slumber

Blissfully unaware of this worried, turbulent heart

Torrential. Undying. Indentured.
