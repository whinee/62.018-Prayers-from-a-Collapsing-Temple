\emph{I can't match your breaths after all}

I wish I can command your body to slow down your breathing

Even at sleep, you still feel agitated

I cant help but also feel the same

\emph{I can't match your heart after all}

I don't know what you want from me

But I do know what I want from you

And I'm not asking for a lot

Actually, maybe I am

After all, my ex said that I was high-maintenance

\emph{I can't match you after all}
