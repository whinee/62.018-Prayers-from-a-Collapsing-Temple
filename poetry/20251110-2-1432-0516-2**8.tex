This ever-growing ache in my heart is swelling up

I wish that I could be of service to you

I wish that I could be there for you

They say that you can't get happiness by chasing it

But by being in service to others, we can get it

Then, why is my heart aching?

Erase the doubts

\textbf{\emph{Fuck}}, then ``love you''

Then go back on doubting once more
