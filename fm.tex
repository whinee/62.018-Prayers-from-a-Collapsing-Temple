\begin{preface}
This whole book actually started as a running joke between me, my muse, and our little circle of friends. We were going through\ldots let's just say, \textit{peak emotional clownery}, enough that a small committee of friends had to step in and supervise the situation.

One of those friends (let's call her \textit{C}) kept asking what exactly was going on. But we couldn't really explain it at the time, for reasons that were less \textit{"scandalous"} and more \textit{"we don't want to drop our emotional tax documents on a minor."}

So the original plan was to document the chaos in a silly little book and hand it to \textit{C} once she was old enough to appreciate the full saga without falling into the void with us.

But somewhere along the way, my muse looked at me and went, \textit{"Why don't you just\ldots publish it?"}

And honestly? She was right. So here we are: with a version that contains only the parts of the story that are actually meant to be shared, wrapped in poems, feelings, and footnotes. The rest stays with us, where it belongs.

To my muse, thanks for the Blåhaj. I love you.

% \begin{introduction}

% The word \textit{traffic} becomes \textit{teletraffic} in telecommunications, as communications becomes telecommunications to indicate technology use, e.g., conversation from some distance through phones or Internet. The term teletraffic covers all kinds of computer communication traffic and telecom traffic.  This book includes teletraffic loss models.
